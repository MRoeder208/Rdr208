                <p>Hello! My name is Mitchell, and I’m a 21-year-old who thrives on adventure and 
					connection. I’m passionate about a variety of activities that keep me active and engaged. 
					Whether it's playing sports, exploring the great outdoors, or indulging in water sports, 
					I’m always on the lookout for the next thrill. Camping is a favorite pastime of mine, 
					where I can immerse myself in nature and disconnect from the hustle and bustle of everyday 
					life.
					
                    Spending quality time with family and friends is incredibly important to me. I cherish the 
					moments we share, whether we’re embarking on a new adventure or just enjoying each other’s 
					company at home. My pet dog is also a central part of my life; he’s not just a pet but a 
					loyal companion who brings endless joy and energy into my world. Billy, which brings joy and 
					companionship to his daily routine, underscoring his compassionate nature and love for animals. 
					                    
                    I’m excited about the future and the countless opportunities for new experiences and connections.

					game and his commitment to personal growth and teamwork.As a coach, my focus is on developing not just 
					skilled players but well-rounded individuals who understand the importance of teamwork, discipline, 
					and sportsmanship. I believe in creating a positive and encouraging environment where each player 
					can reach their full potential. Whether it’s honing their batting technique, perfecting their bowling 
					action, or strategizing on the field, I’m dedicated to helping my players excel.
                    
                    Mitchell also has a strong affinity for woodworking, which allows him to express his creativity

                <p><p>In New South Wales, the TAS (Technology and Applied Studies) teaching areas for Years 
                    7-10 cover a broad spectrum of practical and theoretical subjects designed to equip 
                    students with essential skills and knowledge. These areas typically include introductory 
                    courses in technology, design and technology, and various aspects of applied studies, 
                    emphasizing hands-on learning and problem-solving.</p>
                
                <p>In Years 7-10, the TAS (Technology and Applied Studies) subjects typically include:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Design and Technology - Focuses on the design process, material properties, and practical project work.</li>
                    <li>Digital Technologies - Covers coding, digital systems, and information technology skills.</li>
                    <li>Food Technology - Includes cooking techniques, nutrition, and food safety.</li>
                    <li>Textiles Technology - Emphasizes fabric properties, textile design, and garment construction.</li>
                    <li>Engineering Principles - Introduces basic engineering concepts and problem-solving techniques.</li>
                    <li>Graphics Technology - Involves creating and interpreting technical drawings and visual representations.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>These subjects aim to provide a broad foundation in practical and technological skills.</p>
                
                <p>For Years 11 and 12, the TAS curriculum expands to include specialized courses such as 
                    Industrial Timber and Metal, and Engineering and Construction. The Industrial Timber and 
                    Metal course focuses on advanced techniques in working with timber and metal, enabling 
                    students to develop practical skills in fabrication, machining, and design. Meanwhile, the 
                    Engineering and Construction courses delve into the principles of engineering and the 
                    construction industry, offering insights into structural design, building processes, and 
                    project management. Both of these senior courses prepare students for careers in technical 
                    fields and further education in specialized areas.</p>
